# CGraphNet

## CGraphNet: Contrastive Graph Context Prediction for Sparse Unlabeled Short Text Representation Learning on Social Media

Below is a simplified version of the code on Jupyter Notebook:

(1) Please download the datasets from the provided links and unzip them in their corresponding folders. For the 'Trends-T' dataset, make sure to unzip both 'Trends-T-new_process_data.zip' and 'Trends-T-new_process_item_item_edge_list.zip'.

(2) Please execute 'github_CGraphNet_Tweet.ipynb' for the Tweet dataset and 'github_CGraphNet_Trends-T.ipynb' for the Trends-T dataset. For ease of operation, we have already set the parameters in the code without the need for additional settings. A more complete version will be made public in the revision stage.
